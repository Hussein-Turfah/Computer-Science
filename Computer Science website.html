      Computer science is the study of computers, computing technologies, and computational processes. 
      It deals with the design, development, and analysis of computer software, 
      hardware, and information systems. Computer science involves developing 
      algorithms to solve complex problems and creating programs to implement 
      these algorithms. It also includes understanding how computers and 
      computer systems work, how to store and retrieve information, and 
      how to communicate with other computer systems.

      History of Computer Science
    </h2>
    <p>
      Computer science has its roots in mathematics and logic, dating 
      back to the ancient Greeks. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, 
      pioneers like Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage developed early 
      computing machines and algorithms. The first electronic digital 
      computer, the Atanasoff-Berry computer, was built in the 1930s. 
      During World War II, computers were used to solve complex 
      mathematical calculations and codebreaking. In the 1950s and 
      60s, the development of high-level programming languages and the 
      creation of the first integrated circuits paved the way for the 
      modern computer age. Since then, computer science has continued 
      to evolve and expand, with the development of personal computers, 
      the internet and mobile devices.
